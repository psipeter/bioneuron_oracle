# bioneuron_oracle

Includes methods for specifying weights into an emsemble of biologically realistic neurons such that it performs representation and dynamics according to the NEF. These 'bioneurons' are implemented in NEURON based off of a reduced model of a pyramidal neuron by Bahl et al (2012). It begins by defining a bioneuron class that includes the NEURON objects needed to track voltage, spikes, etc, as well as the required nengo methods to run in simulation. It then redefines some classes in the nengo builder to allow construction of bioensembles and transmission of spikes to the bioneurons' synapses. During the build, synapses are created at specified locations on the bioneurons' dendrites, and are assigned a synaptic weight that has been decomposed into encoders and decoders. Whereas previous bioneuron methods trained the enoders, this repo seeks to distribute encoders randomly in a manner that ensures heterogeneity of bioneuron response curves, then trains decoders using NEF methods such as the least-squares solver or Aaron Voelker's Oracle. It then provides tests for the efficacy of these procedures by finding the error in the bioensemble's decoded output for various choices of encoder, decoder, and dynamical system.
